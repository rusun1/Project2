Scientific question: Is there a significant difference in the amino acid sequence of CYP1A2 and other enzymes that metabolize drugs, which explains why CYP1A2 is responsible for 95% of primary caffeine metabolism?

Hypothesis: If the CYP1A2 sequence is significantly different than the other similar enzyme sequences from the CYP family, then that explains why CYP1A2 is the primary metabolizing enzyme of caffeine.

In this repository, the following files are needed to run the code:
1) 1w0g.pdb - this is a protein structure of the CYP3A4 enzyme
2) cyp_p450.fasta - this is a fasta file containing the sequences of the 13 p450 cytochromes that were analyzed: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP2B6, CYP2J2

Packages to be installed with the following commands

The notebook for running all the code was written in Pythonn
