Scientific question: Is there a significant difference in the amino acid sequence of CYP1A2 and other enzymes that metabolize drugs, which explains why CYP1A2 is responsible for 95% of primary caffeine metabolism?

Hypothesis: If the CYP1A2 sequence is significantly different than the other similar enzyme sequences from the CYP family, then that explains why CYP1A2 is the primary metabolizing enzyme of caffeine.
